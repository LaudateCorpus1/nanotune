Capacitance Model
=================


The capacitance model:
It simulated quantum dots as a system of capacitors connecting charge and
voltages nodes, i.e. dots and gates respectively. Beside calculating integer
number of charges on charge nodes, the model doesn't involve any dot or
material physics.
